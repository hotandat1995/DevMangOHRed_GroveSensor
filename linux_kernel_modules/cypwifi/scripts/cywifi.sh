# The Broadcom/Cypress uses the WL_REG_ON gpio to bring out of reset, but
# needs 2 sleep cycles after VBAT & VDDIO is applied before it is
# turned on. Both the WP76 & 85 are setup to connect GPIO 33 to WL_REG_ON,
# though its configurable on the command-line. It seems with the current
# way that the GPIO expander is being initialized this is not needed, nor
# does the routing need to be setup for SDIO going to the Cypress chip
# rather than the SD card. The SD card was supposed to be the default.

# The WP76 series has an SDHCI-MSM driver that has been setup to run in polled
# mode. Whereas, the WP85 has an MSM-SDCC driver that has been setup to run in
# suspend mode. Thus, we need to kick-start the MSM-SDCC controller on the WP85
# to rescan the bus, but not on the WP76.
